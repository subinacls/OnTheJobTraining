# sometimes node.js files are a nest of crap, I am not to fond of such things.
# sometimes the files are intentionally obfuscated with base64 and an eval string
# might not be a wise idea in the context of security 
# want to have a clean display of the JS code ?
# use this function to pretty print the code to STDOUT or pipe to a file ...

# if the output has some base64 eval statement 
# you can reflect these eval statements and print pretty to STDOUT
