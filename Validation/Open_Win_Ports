# Whitebox evaluation of a windows machine from an unauthenticated, external prospective.
# Useful for when you need to validate the ports are only accessible to internal trusted networks & interfaces
# This should be done in 2 phases. You can still use the same function and test both UP and DOWN firewall scenarios
# This can validate if an application is localhost only, or if it is bound to an ethernet interface.
# First step on the target Windows host:
#   Run as a privledged user: 'netstat -anbp tcp'
# Step two, copy the commands output and save to your local Linux filesystem
# Run the ValidateWinNetstat function as shown
## ValidateWinNetstat <your_netstat_output.file>
#
ValidateWinNetstat() {

# After the command has completed you should have a file which exist in the current working directory of the user
# prior to launching. This file will now contain any services which nmap was able to solicite and make a full handshark
# grabbed banners and attempted to identify unknow services. This can be used to validate the Operating Systems firewalls.
# To do this, you need to run the ValidateWinNetstat against the host in 2 different sessions
#  Session 1: Firewall condition UP
#  Session 2: Firewall condition DOWN
# After you have captured scans from both conditions you can now validate which ports are open and which are not.
# Or just use the following function to do the diff and parse the results.



# Make a service to port number list for later validation
