The Windows Loopback .... Where is it now ?

  Oddly Wireshark does not allow for a person to sniff loopback interfaces... 
  If you have installed wireshark on a more modern system, you may not be able to see these interfaces

  to accomplish this - you simply need to just use 

  npcap from nmap - or simply click the link below:

  https://nmap.org/npcap/

  After downloading, you can now install this package with admin rights
  and remove the winpcap driver loaded on the system!!! Horray!!

  Now you simlply can see these previously restricted interfaces

  happy hacking
