Examining WMI processes I stumbled into an article from Microsoft on WMI and powershell.
They oddly enough include how to run and hide a programs execution from end users view through WMI and powershell

Lets examine the process ...

$startup=[wmiclass]"Win32_ProcessStartup"
$startup.Properties['ShowWindow'].value=$False
([wmiclass]"win32_Process").create('notepad.exe','C:\',$Startup)

sets variable $startup to a Win32_ProcessStartup call
sets argument to the Process call with ['ShowWindow'].value set to False
creates the WMI Win32_Process "create" with the arguments 
  application to execute
  Path to the executable
  the WIn32 API function to use
  
and thats it ... copy and save as start_inv_process.ps1 and your good to go -
make the ps1 take an user argument to make it more functional
